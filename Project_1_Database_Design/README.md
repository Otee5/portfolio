## Project 1 â€“ Customer Database Management

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the creation, management, and querying of a CUSTOMER table using Oracle 19c.
This project focuses on database design, SQL query execution, and verifying results.

## Tools

Oracle SQL 19c â€“ for database creation, management, and querying

SQL Scripts â€“ .sql files used to create tables and execute queries

## What I Built

Created a CUSTOMER table with the following columns:
CUSTOMER_ID, COMPANY_NAME, CONTACT_NAME, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP, PHONE

Wrote SQL scripts to:

Insert records

Update records

Retrieve data using SELECT statements

Verified outputs in Oracle 19c to ensure the database was correctly set up and queries returned the expected results.

## Files
File Name	Description

## How to Run

Open Oracle SQL Developer or SQL*Plus.

Run customer_table_creation.sql to create the CUSTOMER table.

Run customer_queries.sql to insert data and perform queries.

Verify the output in Oracle 19c by checking the results (refer to the screenshot below).
